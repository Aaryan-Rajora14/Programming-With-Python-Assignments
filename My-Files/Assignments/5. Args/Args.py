# Assignment on * args in python function
# 1.Write a function that accepts a variable number of numeric arguments and returns their sum.
# Use Case: This function could be used in a financial application where the total cost of multiple items needs to be calculated.

# 2.Write a function that accepts any number of string arguments and concatenates them into a single string, separated by spaces.
# Use Case: This function could be used in a text-processing tool to combine multiple user inputs into a single sentence or paragraph.

# 3.Write a function that accepts any number of numerical arguments and returns the maximum value.
# Use Case: This function can be used in a data analytics project to find the maximum value from a set of dynamically provided data points.

# 4.Filter and Apply Function ( Try is questions, if not able to do then we will see the solution for the same in the class )
# Write a function that takes a function and a variable number of arguments, filters out non-numeric values, and applies the function to the remaining arguments.
# Use Case: This is useful in a machine learning or data processing project, where you might need to clean input data and apply transformations.
# Python code
# def filter_and_apply(func, *args): 
# # Your code here 

# # Example (assuming we pass the built-in sum function): print(filter_and_apply(sum, 1, 2, 'a', 3, 4, 'b')) # Expected Output: 10

# 5.Create a function that accepts a varying number of items, each represented as a dictionary containing an item's name and price. The function should return the total cost of the items.
# Use Case: This can be used in an e-commerce platform where customers can add any number of items to their shopping cart.
